# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage - premium enterprise version with internal memory improvements (legacy common core from August 2015)

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android/iOS/macOS with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

This plugin version is available under GPL v3 (<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt>) or commercial license options, based on components available under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. Contact for commercial license: <sales@litehelpers.net>

Commercial licenses for Cordova-sqlite-evcore and [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free) are NOT valid for this plugin version. Contact for upgrade: <sales@litehelpers.net>

This plugin version branch contains the premium improvements to the internal JSON interface for iOS and macOS which is to be merged into the `cordova-plugin-sqlite-evplus-ext-common-free` plugin version.

NOTE (TBD): no Circle CI or Travis CI working in this version branch.

WARNING: This plugin version branch is not meant for production. There are multiple data loss risk issues that have been resolved in newer plugin versions. Other known data corruption risks such as "Multiple SQLite problem" are documented in newer plugin versions. There are additional known issues that have been resovled in newer plugin versions.

XXX TBD Android implementation not expected to work in this plugin version branch: flat JSON interface adjusted for iOS/macOS only; Android JARs not present

## Status

- Features omitted from this plugin version branch: pre-populated database support, BASE64, REGEXP extension for iOS/macOS
- Windows platform is not enabled, supported in this plugin version branch. Known issues include:
  - Database close and delete operations not implemented in this plugin version branch
  - No background processing (for future consideration)
  - Not integrated, not tested with a Windows 10 (or Windows Phone 10) target
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree support is tested working OK in this version (for target platforms Android/iOS/macOS/Windows "Universal")
- Status for the other target platforms:
  - Android: using [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) (with sqlite `3.7.17`), with support for FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree
  - iOS/macOS: uses builtin `libsqlite3.dylib`
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3)
- FTS3, FTS4, and R-Tree support is tested working OK in this version (for all target platforms Android/iOS/Windows "Universal")

## Announcements

- This plugin version branch includes premium improvements to the internal JSON interface between Javascript and native parts on Android, iOS, and macOS which improves the performance and resolves memory issues in case of some very large SQL batches.

## Highlights

- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known, can be reconfigured (iOS/macOS platform); synchronized to iCloud by default in this plugin version branch (iOS platform only - can be disabled as described below).
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html

## Some apps using this plugin

TBD

## Known issues

- Multi-page apps are not supported and possibly broken on multiple platforms
- Using web workers is not supported
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS platform when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time. The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- _The Android platform implementation does not support more than 100 open db files due to the threading model used._
- UNICODE `\u2028` (line separator) and `\u2029` (paragraph separator) characters are not supported, known to be not working on multiple platforms.
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- _Storage and retrieval of BLOB data type is not supported consistently on all platforms according to HTML5/[Web SQL DRAFT API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) (possible issues with SELECT BLOB column value type). Recommended solutoin: SELECT BLOB in HEX format using HEX function_
- UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Android or Windows/Windows Phone (8.1)
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.
- iOS/macOS platform implementation uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access
- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation
- ATTACH another database file is not supported (due to path specifications, which work differently depending on the target platform)
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.

## Limited support (testing needed)

- UNICODE characters not fully on Windows
- JOIN needs to be tested more.

## Other versions

- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) - Cordova sqlite storage plugin with permissive licensing terms, supported for more platforms.
- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter) - supports [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android, iOS and macOS
- Original version for iOS (with a different API): [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin)

## Other SQLite adapter projects

- [EionRobb / phonegap-win8-sqlite](https://github.com/EionRobb/phonegap-win8-sqlite) - WebSQL add-on for Win8/Metro apps (perhaps with a different API), using an old version of the C++ library from [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) (as referenced by [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8))
- [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) - C++ component that provides a nice SQLite API with promises for WinJS
- [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8) - old, unofficial version of Cordova API support for Windows 8 Metro that includes an old version of the C++ [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT)
- [MSOpenTech / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-websql) - Windows 8(+) and Windows Phone 8(+) WebSQL plugin versions in C#
- [MetaMemoryT / websql-client](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-client) - provides the same API and connects to [websql-server](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-server) through WebSockets.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS/macOS *only*) with the following choices (deprecated in favor of `iosDatabaseLocation` setting in newer plugin versions):
- `0` (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which platform version is used:
- For Android, one background thread per db;
- for iOS/macOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- for Windows "Universal" (8.1), no background processing (for future consideration).

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS/macOS *only*, deprecated in favor of `iosDatabaseLocation` setting in newer plugin versions)

**NOTE:** not implemented for Windows "Universal" (8.1) version in this plugin version branch.

# Installing

<!-- XXX SECTIONS GONE:
## Windows "Universal" target platform

**PREREQUISITE** in this version branch *ONLY*: install recent version of `sqlite3.[hc]` in `src/external` and make sure the following constants are defined: `#define SQLITE_TEMP_STORE 2` `#define SQLITE_THREADSAFE 2` and for Windows Phone 8.1 *only*: `#define SQLITE_WIN32_FILEMAPPING_API 1`

**IMPORTANT:** There are issues supporing certain Windows target platforms due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866):
- When using Visual Studio, the default target ("Mixed Platforms") will not work
- Problems have been with the Windows "Universal" version case of a Cordova project using a Visual Studio template/extension instead of Cordova/PhoneGap CLI or `plugman`
As an alternative, which will support the ("Mixed Platforms") target, you can use `plugman` instead with [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix), as described here.

### Using plugman to support "Mixed Platforms"

- make sure you have the latest version of `plugman` installed: `npm install -g plugman`
- Download the [cordova-windows-nufix 3.9.0-nufixpre-01 zipball](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix/archive/3.9.0-nufixpre-01.zip) (or you can clone [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) instead)
- Create your Windows "Universal" (8.1) project using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix):
  - `path.to.cordova-windows-nufix/bin/create.bat your_app_path your.app.id YourAppName`
- `cd your_app_path` and install plugin using `plugman`:
  - `plugman install --platform windows --project . --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common`
- Put your sql program in your project `www` (don't forget to reference it from `www\index.html` and wait for `deviceready` event)

Then your project in `CordovaApp.sln` should work with "Mixed Platforms" on both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, or `windows`.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).
- -->

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-plugin-sqlite-evplus-ext-common-free#cordova-sqlite-evplus-legacy-common-exp-core

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**WARNING:** for Windows target platform please read the section above.

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)
- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - `external` - placeholder used to import `sqlite-connector.jar`, `sqlite-native-driver.jar` (needed for Android version), and `sqlite3.[hc]` (needed to build Windows "Universal" (8.1) version) in this version branch
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS/macOS;
   - `windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows "Universal" (8.1);
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0), ported from QUnit `test-www` test suite, working on all platforms
- `tests`: very simple Jasmine test suite that is run on Circle CI (Android version) and Travis CI (iOS version)
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

<!-- XXX GONE:
## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0, using the `lib/android/example` subdirectory from the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball.

 - Install `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into `assets/www`
 - Install `SQLitePlugin.java` from `src/android/io/liteglue` into `src/io/liteglue` subdirectory
 - Install the `libs` subtree with `sqlite-connector.jar` and `sqlite-native-driver.jar` into your Android project
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="io.liteglue.SQLitePlugin"/>` to `res/xml/config.xml`

Sample change to `res/xml/config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-19

(assuming Android SDK 19, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following changes to `SQLitePlugin.java`:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

- Copy `SQLitePlugin.[hm]` from `src/ios` into your project Plugins folder and add them in XCode (I always just have "Create references" as the option selected).
- Copy `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into your project `www` folder
- Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml`

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

_First check the following:_
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

XXX TBD where to report issues on this plugin version branch (which is NOT meant for production use)

## Community forum

TBD

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:

    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run then from a windows powershell do either

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

or for Windows (8.1):

    .\bin\test.ps1 windows

# Adapters

<!-- MOVED:
## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

**NOTE:** The PouchDB adapter has not been tested with the Android version which is using the new [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector).

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your `master` branch. In general, contributions are rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues at [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues) can help improve the quality of this plugin.
- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and are working for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible.
- If you see a need for restructuring, it is better to first discuss it in the forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) (or in a [new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/new)) where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Remember to make (and use) a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation with any other changes in the same commit.
